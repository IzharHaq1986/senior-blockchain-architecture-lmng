# LMNG Token – Smart Contract Project (Hardhat v2)

This repository demonstrates a complete end-to-end Ethereum smart contract workflow using **Hardhat v2**, **Ethers.js v5**, and a **local development blockchain**.  
It is designed as a clean, professional sample to showcase blockchain engineering expertise for GitHub, Upwork, Fiverr, and other freelancing platforms.

---

## Features

- Hardhat v2 development environment  
- Ethers.js v5 integration  
- Local blockchain simulation using `npx hardhat node`  
- Automated deployment script  
- Minimal ERC-style token contract (`LMNGToken.sol`)  
- Clean, client-ready project structure  
- Easy to extend for future smart contract work

## Deploy Locally

### 1. Start the Hardhat Local Node
npx hardhat node

This launches a local Ethereum network with accounts preloaded with ETH.

---

### 2. Deploy the LMNGToken Contract

In a second terminal:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
You will see output similar to:
Contract deployment: LMNGToken
Contract address: 0xABC123...
Transaction: 0xDEF456...

Copy the contract address for interaction.

---

## Interact With the Contract

### 1. Open Hardhat Console
npx hardhat console --network localhost

### 2. Attach to the Deployed Contract

```js
const LMNG = await ethers.getContractFactory("LMNGToken");
const token = LMNG.attach("<YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>");

3. Read Public Variables
await token.name();          // "LMNG Token"
await token.symbol();        // "LMNG"
(await token.totalSupply()).toString();

About This Project
This repository is a portfolio-quality example demonstrating:
Solidity smart contract development
Local blockchain orchestration with Hardhat
Deployment and interaction using Ethers.js
Clean project organization
Production-ready workflow on Ubuntu
It can be extended with tests, CI/CD, advanced token logic, frontend dApps, or ABI exports.
