# LMNG Token – Smart Contract Project (Hardhat v2)

This repository demonstrates a complete end-to-end Ethereum smart contract workflow using **Hardhat v2**, **Ethers.js v5**, and a **local development blockchain**.  
It is designed as a clean, professional sample to showcase blockchain engineering expertise for GitHub, Upwork, Fiverr, and other freelancing platforms.

---

## Features

- Hardhat v2 development environment  
- Ethers.js v5 integration  
- Local blockchain simulation using `npx hardhat node`  
- Automated deployment script (`scripts/deploy.js`)  
- Minimal ERC-style token contract (`contracts/LMNGToken.sol`)  
- Clean, client-ready project structure  
- Easy to extend with tests, CI/CD, or frontend dApps

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS recommended)
npm
Git
Install dependencies:
npm install

Deploy Locally
1. Start the Hardhat Local Node
npx hardhat node
This launches a local Ethereum network with pre-funded, unlocked accounts suitable for development and testing.

2. Deploy the LMNGToken Contract
In a second terminal, from the project root:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
You will see output similar to:
Contract deployment: LMNGToken
Contract address: 0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3
Transaction: 0x...
Gas used: ...
Copy the contract address; you will need it to interact with the token.

Interact With the Contract
1. Open Hardhat Console
npx hardhat console --network localhost

2. Attach to the Deployed Contract
const LMNG = await ethers.getContractFactory("LMNGToken");
const token = LMNG.attach("0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3"); // replace with your actual deployed address

3. Read Public Values
await token.name();          // "LMNG Token"
await token.symbol();        // "LMNG"
(await token.totalSupply()).toString();

Documentation
Additional design notes and token/chain considerations are documented in:
docs/chains-and-tokens-spec.md
This file explains the broader architecture decisions and how this simple token can fit into a larger blockchain system.
