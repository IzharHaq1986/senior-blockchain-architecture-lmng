# **LMNG-Style Blockchain Architecture (Draft)**

This repository explores a senior-level approach to planning a multi-chain token and puzzle ecosystem. The idea is to walk through the architectural thinking that usually happens before any Solidity code is written. It sets the stage for choosing chains, designing token behavior, and understanding how puzzles and rewards could interact with on-chain logic.

The main document in this repo is here:  
**docs/chains-and-tokens-spec.md**

That file outlines the early decisions a blockchain engineer would make while shaping a system like this. It’s meant to show how the planning process works, what needs to be proposed upfront, and which items should remain open until clarified.

Future updates will add sample Solidity contracts, a few deployment scripts, and a small React interface to show how these ideas move from planning to implementation.

## Project Roadmap (High-Level)

This repository will grow in small steps. The next updates will include:

1. Sample ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 contract outlines.
2. A Hardhat or Foundry development environment for local testing.
3. Deployment scripts for testnets.
4. A small Node.js backend to handle metadata and API interactions.
5. A simple React interface to show how the pieces connect.
