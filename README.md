LMNG-Style Blockchain Architecture (Draft)
This repository explores a senior-level approach to planning a multi-chain token and
puzzle ecosystem.The idea is to walk through the architectural thinking that usually
happens before any Solidity code is written.It sets the stage for choosing chains, 
designing token behavior, and understanding how puzzles and rewards could interact
with on-chain logic.

The main document in this repo is here:
docs/chains-and-tokens-spec.md

That file outlines the early decisions a blockchain engineer would make while shaping
a system like this. It’s meant to show how the planning process works, what needs to be 
proposed upfront, and which items should remain open until clarified.

Future updates will add sample Solidity contracts, a few deployment scripts, and a small 
React interface to show how these ideas move from planning to implementation.
